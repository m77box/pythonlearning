# Question 4: Longest Palindromic Substring
def longest_palindromic_substring(s):
    # Your code goes here
    # Initialize variables to keep track of the longest palindrome found
    # Use a nested loop to check all substrings and see if they are palindromes

    pass

# Expected: "bab" or "aba" (both are valid palindromic substrings)
